# AWS-Web-Security  
**Dissertation Report on Web Security**  

## Section 2: Statement of Project Details  

### 2.1 Project Title  
**Web Security**  

### 2.2 Academic Question  
What are the potential security risks and solutions associated with web applications?  

### 2.3 Aims  
- Analyse all the security risks and methods to defend against discrepancies.  
- Design and implement a database-driven website for storing confidential information.  
- Use SSL and HTTPS for a secure connection between the client and the user.  

### 2.4 Objectives  
- Design a secure online e-commerce store with a secure registration and login system.  
- Test the application using a vulnerability scanner to assess the level of security.  
- Host the web application on AWS Cloud Server and utilize AWS security features.  

### 2.5 Artefact (Proposed) to be Developed  
An online prototype e-commerce store will be developed as the project artefact.  
It will be highly functional and secure for potential online customers, providing a registration and login system to keep user information safe from security threats.  

A database will be implemented for storing:  
- Product information  
- Prices  
- Customer details  
- Usernames and passwords  

The web application will be hosted on the **Amazon Web Services (AWS)** cloud platform.  
A test plan will be created to evaluate results from a web application vulnerability scanner, measuring potential security risks and providing solutions to tackle any discrepancies.
